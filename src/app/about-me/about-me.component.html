        <h1>Alexander Kummerer</h1>
        <p> I started my Carrer as a logistics Expert in the Airfreight Export sector. In recent years I have gotten a very great interest in technology and the logic behind system. Last Year, I decided to start to learn Front-End Developmen in a profesional
            Software Developement school. I'd really felt in love with devolopement and decided to begin a new jouney as Front-End Developer and quit my job. I have done work in software Developement, Front-End, Database/Sever management, Design and Jump
            and Run Game Developement. <br> <br> In my freetime i love to go hiking and train with the body. I like reading several kinds of books like Physology, Mindset, Sci-FI and fairy tales. I'm always looking for new Journey's and a growing mind.
